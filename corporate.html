          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our brand, Theatralia, focuses on making theatre accessible to everyone around Europe. We acknowledge the importance of providing equitable access to theatre plays for every theatre lover in the form of a theatre pass. Our values are fostering connections, passion for the performing arts and accessibility. Our marketing campaign aims to spread awareness and provoke curiosity about our new website and the services that can be found on it. Furthermore, we want our audience to foster a sense of community by coming along on the journey of developing our brand that is tailored to their needs.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Our target audience is made up of international young adults between the ages of 18-25. Most of them are working students who are cultural enthusiasts, socializers and enjoy art as a form of escaping from daily struggles. According to Throsby et al. (2023) theatre-goes of all ages prefer experiences that engage the intellect and emotions. Also, one in five 16 to 24 year olds said that going to a live performance or musical would be their perfect evening out with friends giving them the chance to connect with others (Zest Theatre’s Toby Ealden: How Can We Get Generation Z Into Theatres?, n.d.).</p>
<p>According to (Statista, 2024) the top 3 most used platforms of our target audience as of September 2023 are: YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. Furthermore, our team conducted interviews with members of our target audience where this statistic was confirmed. The interviewees mentioned that their preferred platforms are Instagram, for connecting with people and TikTok as a means of gathering information in the shape of short-form, entertaining videos. Based on the statistics and the interviews previously mentioned, our chosen platforms are Tiktok and Instagram (Zote, 2024). On these platforms we will make posts during the week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and during the weekend on Saturday according to the newly observed media behaviours at the beginning of 2024 (Braoulias, 2024). As for the times, according to Ghatak (2024), over-all the best times to post on social media are between 6 PM to 9 PM and 12 PM to 3 PM. Our chosen content format will be reels and still (edited) images for Instagram as well as videos for TikTok which will take the form of the newest entertaining trends but with an added layer of information. With this in mind we created the following content calendar (below, 1st tab of the document):</p>
			<a href = "https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/220111_buas_nl/EUj8wGf1HFtImk7JoapTl9wB9uZnRNXnmfyzQ-tq-Kqm5g?e=Uq4GTN">PRJ4 Content Planning.xls&nbsp;</a>
		  <h4>Objectives</h4>
		  <p>Reach objective: We want to reach 100 accounts by the 1st of April. 

Affect objective: We want our audience to feel curious towards the new products by the 1st of April.  

We can measure this by:  

Instagram: We will keep track of impressions, post reach, follower count, following growth rate and reactions (likes and interactions) 

TikTok: We will keep track of video views, likes and profile views. 

Response objective:  

We want 75% of the accounts reached to follow our social media by the 1st of April. 

We want 25% of the accounts reached to visit our website by the 1st of April. 

Instagram: We will keep track of impressions, post reach, follower count, following growth rate and reactions (likes and interactions) </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During the marketing campaign, we learned how important it is to understand your target audience thoroughly and to identify their social media usage patterns. Our thorough analysis of the audience through research and interviews enabled us to create content that maximized our reach in the short 4 weeks of promotion that we had. Although the campaign was short, we managed to gather enough insights to better our future planning for the upcoming weeks of the campaign. We initially expected the creation of the content to be an issue, however we managed to adjust it as needed along the way. For example, we began by posting still images on Instagram, however we realized that we get more exposure through reels, which we started posting more regularly than the images. Another thing that we noticed was the lack of interaction with our posts, which we tried to fix by implementing a new series of posts for a weekly quiz called “Saturday Showdown”, in the hopes of people commenting on the posts. When the quizzes didn't improve the quality of the interactions, we took further measures by posting the questions from the quiz on stories as well. This way we managed to get people to interact more with the content. When it comes to consistency and posting times, our initial research suggested posting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday; which worked well, however the times at which we made our posts initially proved to be less engaging, so by checking our insights (include insight-Appendix 1) and we changed them from 6PM to starting to post between 9AM-12PM. Additionally we encountered some difficulties with gaining followers from the right demographic of our target audience and we decided to conduct some research and follow people who where interested in theatre and who were already following specific hashtags and existing accounts of theatres (include analitycs-Appendix 2). When it comes to our second platform, TikTok, we had the same issues when trying to gain a following, however we did not apply the same tactic as we did for Instagram, which could be a tactic to consider in our future planning or trying to optimize our content more to fit the platform better, as a lot of our TikToks were based on the pre-existing reels that we were posting on Instagram. Moreover, we realized how important preparation is. By preparing our content calendar ahead of time we managed to easily keep on top of our posting schedule or adjust things before posting them if needed. It also helps keep an eye out over whether posts become too repetitive or less engaging for the audience. Over-all our biggest learning points are that consistency, research and attention to the audience are key for a successful marketing campaign, however the complexity of each stage of such a campaign shouldn't be underestimated.</p>
		  
			
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>During the 4 week execution of our campaign, we learned a lot and we examined the success of the promotion by checking if our initial goals were met. </p>
			<h5>Reach Objective </h5>
          <p>Our reach objective was that we wanted to reach 100 accounts by the 1st of April. This objective has proven to be successful with a number of (include number) reaches on Instagram and (include number from unique viewers) reaches on TikTok (Also include screenshots of the numbers from the insights- Appendix 3 &amp; Appendix 4).</p>
			<h5>Response Objectives </h5>
          <p>Our response objectives were getting 75% of the accounts reached to follow our social media (which meant 75 followers for a reach of 100) and 25% of the accounts reached to visit our website by the 1st of April (which means 25 accounts for 100 accounts reached).  

When it comes to followers, on Instagram we gathered (number of followers), which is equivalent to (include the percentage of followers). For TikTok we gathered (include number of followers), which is equivalent for (include percentage of followers) (include pictures for evidence- Appendix 5 and Appendix 6). This shows that (include conclusion).  

When it comes to people visiting our website, this goal hasn't been reached due to the website not being finished and available to the target audience.  </p>
			<h5>Affect Objective </h5>
		  <p>For our affect objective, we wanted our audience to feel curious towards our new product by the 1st of April. On Instagram we measured this aspect by tracking impressions (include number of impressions), post reaches (include the lowest reaching post and the highest reaching post number), following growth rate (include number for growth rate) and reactions (likes and interactions) (include number of the last two)(include evidence pictures- Appendix 7). On TikTok we kept track of video views (include number), likes (include number) and profile views (include number) (include evidence pictures- Appendix 8). This shows that (make conclusion).  </p>
		  <h5>Future Planning Based on Reflection of the Objective Performance  </h5>
			<p>As mentioned in the learning points, there are aspects that we would like to improve moving forward with our campaign.  

For the upcoming 4 weeks we want to focus on reaching the goals that haven't previously been achieved and adjust the ones that have accordingly (write which ones based on the conclusions from the previous paragraph).  

To ensure us reaching the new desired outcome, we plan on implementing more reels in our Instagram posts as well as creating more tailored content for TikTok instead of reposting the Instagram reels. Moreover, we will start posting our quiz series based on when our audience is more active to ensure we get the most exposure and chance of engagement out of them. When it comes to stories, a higher number of them should be made weekly due to their high potential of driving traffic to the page. We will also continue to post the upcoming content based on the newly found best times and days of posting (include them based on the insights- Appendix 9).  

When it comes to followers, we will start implementing the strategy of reaching out to accounts with previous similar interests on TikTok as we did on Instagram to make sure we will be seen by the right demographic, and on Instagram we will try to further foster a bond with our existing followers and get them to engage with the newly formatted content.  

We will also make sure to prepare our content calendar ahead of time as that proved to be helpful with consistency and changes in the previous weeks of promotion.  

With this in mind we created the following content calendar for the upcoming 4 weeks (belo, 2nd tab of the document : </p>
